# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Description
This project is a machine learning model that predicts whether passengers on the Titanic survived or not. It's a classic example of binary classification, where we use features like passenger class, gender, age, and more to make predictions. The model is trained on the Titanic dataset and uses a Random Forest classifier to make predictions. The initial version of the project used a simple linear regression model, and we split the data into training and test sets using the train_test_split function from the Pandas library.

## Features
1. Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
2. Model training and evaluation.
3. Predicting survival on new data.
   
## Getting Started:
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### Clone the repository to your local machine.
1. Install the required Python packages by running 
  ```
   pip install pandas sklearn.
  ```
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook titanic_prediction.ipynb to see the code and run the model.
### Usage
In the Jupyter Notebook, you can see examples of loading data, preprocessing, training the model, and making predictions. You can also input new passenger data to see if they would have survived on the Titanic.
